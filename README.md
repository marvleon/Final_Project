# Final_Project

This is my final project for CS 463. Its a portfolio webpage with information about me, courses I've taken, some of my previous projects and a way to contact me. I utilized an API made by https://github.com/wh-iterabb-it that returns fun cat facts because I love cats! I also used this guide to flex box https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/ to help me structure my website. Website inspiration came from portland.craigslist.org because I find myself frequently using my local classifieds. Thanks for reading!

# Deployment

This website is deployed using github pages. I ran the code locally during production using the Live Server extension in VScode
